# docker-compose-yml
Let's review each section:

# Services:

        todo-db service: This service uses the diamol/postgres:11.5 image, which pulls the PostgreSQL version 11.5. The service maps the host port 5433 to the container port 5432. This allows external applications to connect to the PostgreSQL database running in the container. The service is connected to the app-net network.

        todo-web service: This service uses the diamol/ch06-todo-list image. It maps the host port 8020 to the container port 80, making the web application accessible on port 8020. The environment variable Database:Provider=Postgres is set, specifying that the application should use PostgreSQL as the database provider. The service depends on the todo-db service, ensuring that the database container is started before the web application container. The service is also connected to the app-net network.

# Secrets:
    The todo-web service specifies a secret named postgres-connection using the secrets keyword.
    The secret file specified by source: postgres-connection is mounted to the path /app/config/secrets.json inside the container. This             allows the web application to access sensitive information, such as database connection details or other secrets, from the secrets.json file.

# Networks:
    The app-net network is defined as an external network with the name nat. The services todo-db and todo-web are connected to this network, allowing them to communicate with each other.

In summary, this Docker Compose configuration sets up two services: a PostgreSQL database (todo-db) and a web application (todo-web). The services are connected to the app-net network, and the necessary ports are mapped for external access. The todo-web service also uses a secret file (secrets.json) for accessing sensitive information. The dependencies between the services are specified using depends_on, ensuring that the database container is started before the web application container.

If you intend to bind a folder from the host to the container, you would use the volumes section instead, like this:


```bash
volumes:
  - /path/on/host:/path/in/container
```
