# docker-compose-yml
Let's review each section:

    Services:

        todo-db service: This service uses the diamol/postgres:11.5 image, which pulls the PostgreSQL version 11.5. The service maps the host port 5433 to the container port 5432. This allows external applications to connect to the PostgreSQL database running in the container. The service is connected to the app-net network.

        todo-web service: This service uses the diamol/ch06-todo-list image. It maps the host port 8020 to the container port 80, making the web application accessible on port 8020. The environment variable Database:Provider=Postgres is set, specifying that the application should use PostgreSQL as the database provider. The service depends on the todo-db service, ensuring that the database container is started before the web application container. The service is also connected to the app-net network.

    Secrets:
    The todo-web service specifies a secret named postgres-connection using the secrets keyword. The secret file specified by source: postgres-connection is mounted to the path /app/config/secrets.json inside the container. This allows the web application to access sensitive information, such as database connection details or other secrets, from the secrets.json file.

    Networks:
    The app-net network is defined as an external network with the name nat. The services todo-db and todo-web are connected to this network, allowing them to communicate with each other.

In summary, this Docker Compose configuration sets up two services: a PostgreSQL database (todo-db) and a web application (todo-web). The services are connected to the app-net network, and the necessary ports are mapped for external access. The todo-web service also uses a secret file (secrets.json) for accessing sensitive information. The dependencies between the services are specified using depends_on, ensuring that the database container is started before the web application container.

The environment section in the Docker Compose file allows you to set environment variables for a specific service. In the provided example:

yaml

environment:
  - Database:Provider=Postgres

The Datab

ase:Provider=Postgres line sets an environment variable within the todo-web service. Here's what it means:

    Database:Provider is the name of the environment variable.
    Postgres is the value assigned to the environment variable.

This environment variable can be accessed by the application running in the todo-web container. The purpose of setting this environment variable is to provide configuration or runtime information to the application, indicating that it should use PostgreSQL as the database provider.

In the application code or configuration, the environment variable Database:Provider can be accessed to determine the database provider to use. The specific implementation details of how the application utilizes this environment variable depend on how the application is designed.

Setting environment variables through the Docker Compose file allows you to configure containers in a consistent and portable manner. It enables you to provide dynamic configuration options to your application without modifying its code or configuration files directly.
